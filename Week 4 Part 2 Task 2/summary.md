## Automated Login Testing with Selenium IDE

We used **Selenium IDE** to automate login tests with both valid and invalid credentials on a public demo site. Selenium IDE records user actions and replays them, ensuring **repeatable and consistent test execution**. 

Its **AI-powered locator strategies**, like fallback selectors, help maintain test stability even when the page structure changes, reducing the maintenance burden compared to manual testing.

Manual testing, especially when verifying multiple credential combinations, is **time-consuming** and **error-prone**. Automated testing addresses these challenges by increasing **test coverage** and allowing us to easily validate a wide range of inputs and edge cases. 

With automation, we receive **immediate feedback on regressions**, accelerating the development cycle and enabling faster iteration. This approach improves confidence in the login functionality, reduces the likelihood of bugs reaching production, and ensures a more **reliable and scalable testing process**.

Overall, Selenium IDE helps teams maintain quality while moving quickly.
